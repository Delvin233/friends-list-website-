packages used in the virutal environmet:
flask
flask-sqlalchemy
flask-cors
flask-smorest

for here we wont create a docker file for it , we would use :
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run(debug=True)
Explanation: the if statement prevents the app.py file from running app.run(debug=True) over and over when it is imported in another file.
It can only be run with python ./app.py

We would have to set our variables in the terminal since we are working in the virtual environmet;
we do this normally in docker :) (missing docker aleady);
the codes are : 
set FLASK_APP = app.py
set FLASK_ENV = development    
flask run --reload

We would also use Postman to test our API's: specifically the VSCode extension
Insomnia can be used as well :)
