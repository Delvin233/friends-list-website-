packages used in the virutal environmet:
flask
flask-sqlalchemy
flask-cors

for here we wont create a docker file for it , we would use :
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run(debug=True)
Explanation: the if statement prevents the app.py file from running app.run(debug=True) over and over when it is imported in another file.
It can only be run with python ./app.py
